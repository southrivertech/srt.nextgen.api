Resources for using the [Titan Server](https://titanftp.com) API with various toolkits.

The various Titan Server platforms contain a REST API that can either be accessed directly via https or via SDK's which are contained in this repository.

The OpenAPI json specification for the REST API can be found here [OpenAPI](https://github.com/southrivertech/titanapi.pub/swagger.json)

You can also access the REST API via swagger on the admin console via the url <https://localhost:31443/swagger/index.html> This will give you an idea of all the commands that are available however generally you will only need a few commands to perform routine tasks like setting a server setting and restarting the server, or adding a user etc.
